# Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript by [Beau Carnes](http://carnes.cc)

[Course YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2CEgPsws3U)

The course is divided in the following sections.

1. [Stacks](./src/01.stacks.js)
2. [Sets](./src/02.sets.js)
3. [Queues & Priority Queues](./src/03.queues.js)
4. [Binary Search Tree](./src/04.bst.js)
5. [Hash Tables](./src/05.hash.tables.js)
6. [Linked List](./src/06.linked.lists.js)
7. [Trie](./src/07.tries.js)
8. [Heap (max and min)](./src/heaps.js)
9. [Graphs: breadth first search](./src/graphs.js)

I implemented each data structure and corresponding methods in the links above (see the _src_ folder). In many cases, my implementations were a little bit different from the ones presented in the course.

> My Opinion:
> Of course, everyones learning style is different, but I really think that the best way to learn this material is to watch part of the videos to get the idea and the main methods, and then try to write your own version of it. Then, watch the course implementation and fix anything in yours that is not working!
